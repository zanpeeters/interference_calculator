    """ For a list of atoms, calculate all molecular ions that can be formed
        from those atoms, including all isotopes, up to maxsize atoms,
        that have a mass-to-charge ratio within mz +/- mzrange.

        The mass-to-charge ratio (mz) can be given as a number or as a
        molecular formula. Molecular formulas are interpreted by Molecule().
        See Molecule() docstring for a detailed explanation on how to enter
        molecular formulas. If mz is None, no filtering will be done and
        all possible combinations of all isotopes up to maxsize length will
        be calculated.

        Charge is usually 1, irrespective of sign. Give charge = [1, 2, 3]
        to also include higher charged ions. Masses are adjusted for missing
        electrons (+ charge) or extra electrons (- charge).

        Molecular formulas are represented in the style in formula_style (default
        is 'html'). See Molecule() for more options.

        Returns a pandas.DataFrame with a column 'molecule' with molecular formula,
        a column 'mass/charge' for the mass-to-charge ratio, a column 'mass/charge diff'
        for the mass/charge difference between this ion and the target ion, a column
        'MRP' which gives the mass-resolving power (mz/Î”mz) needed to resolve the
        target ion from this ion, a column 'charge', and a column 'probability',
        which for now is simply the product of the abundances of the isotopes in
        the given molecular ion.
